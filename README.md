## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning  

I'm always expanding my knowledge in cloud security, automation, and distributed systems. Lately, I've been focusing on refining my **home lab** setup to experiment with **Kubernetes**, infrastructure-as-code, and security automation. My homelab serves as a testing ground for new technologies, allowing me to tinker with self-hosted services, monitoring, and container orchestration.
